Example of Undecorated wxWidgets Application
============================================

This is a very simple example of an application not using any standard
decorations under Microsoft Windows.

Thanks to @rossy for https://github.com/rossy/borderless-window which this
example is strongly based on (but all errors in it are mine alone).
